## ✨ Experience the Journey

Embark on a mystical journey from darkness to light, where ancient symbols await discovery and divine blueprints reveal themselves through sacred geometry. Move your light through the darkness to uncover hidden wisdom spanning millennia.

## 🎮 How to Experience

### 🕯️ **Light Mode** - Symbol Discovery
- **Move your cursor** to illuminate the darkness
- **Discover hidden symbols** representing ancient wisdom
- **Learn their meanings** through interactive tooltips
- **Progress through stages** of enlightenment (3, 5, 7 steps)
- **Explore different pathways** of knowledge

### 📐 **Architect Mode** - Divine Blueprint
- **Switch to blueprint view** to witness creation itself
- **Watch sacred geometry** draw itself in real-time
- **Experience divine proportion** through mathematical beauty
- **See particle effects** celebrate each sacred completion

## 🛤️ Four Pathways of Wisdom

| Pathway | Focus | Symbols |
|---------|-------|---------|
| **Traditional** | Classical geometric principles | Square, Compass, Level, Plumb |
| **Philosophical** | Ancient symbols of enlightenment | Eye, Sacred Triangle, Spiral |
| **Historical** | Architectural and building traditions | Pillars, Temple, Keystone, Arch |
| **Scientific** | Mathematical and astronomical knowledge | Sacred Geometry, Astronomy, Proportion |
